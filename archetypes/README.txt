This is a large collection of archetypes jars built from MEDvision/archetypes.

It's primary use here is to provide a large, stable set of files to load into
unit tests and the like.

Note that the code derived from the openehr reference implementation keeps
its own local .adl files, to make future syncing/merging of the upstream
easier.
