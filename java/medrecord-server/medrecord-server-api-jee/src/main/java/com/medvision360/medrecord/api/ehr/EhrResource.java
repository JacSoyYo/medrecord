     * Soft-delete EHR resource.
     * 
     * Delete a stored EHR. Fully deleting the entire EHR record is not possible. Rather, when deleting an EHR, 
     * it is simply marked as deleted. This also does not delete the contents of an EHR. In OpenEHR, 
     * actually deleting information in bulk is quite uncommon and it is not currently supported through this API.
     * 
     * The main reason to do actual erasure is in response to some kind of data protection request, 
     * and such purge actions should not be taken lightly. To erase all information for a particular subject from the 
     * server:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>fetch their EHR record and mark it as deleted</li>
     *     <li>iterate over all the locatables in their record and delete those</li>
     *     <li>delete the EHRStatus associated with the EHR record</li>
     *     <li>delete the Directory associated with the EHR record, if any</li>
     *     <li>query for all demographic locatables of or about the subject and delete those</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * This will leave behind only an anonymous, flagged-as-deleted EHR record, which can be used by the system to 
     * determine "there was information here but it has been erased".
     * 
     * Built-in API support for such a purge operation may be provided in the future.
