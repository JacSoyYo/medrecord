/**
 * Central interface to a storage system for OpenEHR {@link Locatable} instances. Provides basic CRUD 
 * operations as well as XQuery-based querying.
 * 
 * Since <code>Locatable</code> subtypes are typically versioned objects, the <code>LocatableStore</code> API 
 * provides some support for multi-versioning, though simple non-versioned implementations may choose to implement 
 * {@link #update(Locatable)} to simply always replace the latest version of a locatable and 'forget' about all other
 * history. Stores that implement the full openEHR versioning model for (some types of) locatables SHOULD 
 * additionally implement {@link VersioningStore}.
 * 
 * Since storage facilities for {@link Locatable} implementations typically need to provide strong ACID guarantees, 
 * the <code>LocatableStore</code> interface extends from {@link TransactionalService} and clients SHOULD always use 
 * transaction semantics. However, basic/test/dummy/research implementations <em>only</em> may choose to ignore the 
 * transactions and return true from {@link #supportsTransactions()}.
 * 
 * Store implementations should be robust against transient un-availability of underlying storage mechanisms and 
 * provide insight into storage mechanism availability to clients. To that end, they SHOULD properly implement the
 * {@link StatusService} API}.
 * 
 * The kinds of {@link Locatable} sub-types that are supported may be limited by implementations. For example, 
 * a particular store implementation may (be configured to) support only {@link org.openehr.rm.demographic.Party} or
 * {@link org.openehr.rm.composition.Composition} instances.
 * 
 * Store implementations are typically <em>not</em> expected to implement consistency checks or validation checks on 
 * Locatables beyond those checks that are needed to implement their functionality. For example, 
 * the openEHR reference model <em>implies</em> that a store for demographic information maintain
 * {@link org.openehr.rm.demographic.PartyRelationship} links between {@link org.openehr.rm.demographic.Party} 
 * objects, but the store is not required to implement or enforce that rule. Similarly, 
 * constraints defined in archetypes rather than in the reference model itself are not expected to be implemented by 
 * stores.
