/**
 * Central interface to a storage system for OpenEHR {@link Locatable} instances. Provides basic CRUD operations.
 * <p/>
 * Since storage facilities for {@link Locatable} implementations typically need to provide strong ACID guarantees, the
 * <code>LocatableStore</code> interface extends from {@link TransactionalService} and clients SHOULD always use
 * transaction semantics. However, basic/test/dummy/research implementations <em>only</em> may choose to ignore the
 * transactions and return true from {@link #supportsTransactions()}.
 * <p/>
 * Store implementations should be robust against transient un-availability of underlying storage mechanisms and provide
 * insight into storage mechanism availability to clients. To that end, they SHOULD properly implement the {@link
 * StatusService} API}.
 * <p/>
 * The kinds of {@link Locatable} sub-types that are supported may be limited by implementations. For example, a
 * particular store implementation may (be configured to) support only {@link org.openehr.rm.demographic.Party} or
 * {@link org.openehr.rm.composition.Composition} instances.
 * <p/>
 * Store implementations are typically <em>not</em> expected to implement consistency checks or validation checks on
 * Locatables beyond those checks that are needed to implement their functionality. For example, the openEHR reference
 * model <em>implies</em> that a store for demographic information maintain {@link
 * org.openehr.rm.demographic.PartyRelationship} links between {@link org.openehr.rm.demographic.Party} objects, but the
 * store is not required to implement or enforce that rule. Similarly, constraints defined in archetypes rather than in
 * the reference model itself are not expected to be implemented by stores.
